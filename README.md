# TheTravelingSalesmanProblem
CS 325 Final Project: TSP
- Final project for CS325 Algorithms class at OSU.
- As a group of 3, we investigated The Traveling Salesman Problem through the lens of 3 techniques.
- We looked at: Dynamic Programming, Nearest Neighbor, and Christofides' Algorithm.
- We chose to implement Nearest Neighbor because of runtime limitations, and our results are shown in "Algorithms Final Report-1.pdf"
